An insertion sort creates the sorted list, one item at a time. 
It can start at the beginning of the array, or top of the list, but it can also start at the end.
On each iteration, the process takes an item in the list and performs a comparison of all the 
values preceding it and then "inserts" the item at the correct location, in ascending sorted order.
